# The Story Behind the IndiaNite AR Experience Project

I am **Sasankh Reddy Nandipati**, a master's student at **Wichita State University** and the Event Manager for the **Indian Student Association**. One of my key responsibilities is organizing large-scale events, such as **IndiaNite**, which draws over **500 attendees**, including students and their families. IndiaNite is a celebration of the vibrant Indian culture, featuring music, dance, and food. With such a significant audience, I aimed to modernize the promotional approach to capture the attention of a tech-savvy crowd.

## The Challenge
As I embarked on this project, I faced several challenges:
1. **No Prior Experience with AR**: I had no background in augmented reality, which meant learning the technology from scratch.
2. **Understanding 3D Models**: Handling and integrating 3D models, including formats like **.glb**, was entirely new to me.
3. **Color Rendering Issues**: One major problem was that while 3D models would upload, their colors would often not render as expected, requiring significant adjustments.
4. **Custom Image Integration**: Incorporating custom, theme-specific images into the AR platform in a way that aligned with IndiaNiteâ€™s vision was difficult.
5. **Tracking User Engagement**: Midway through, I realized that tracking the number of scans for each QR code would provide valuable insights into user engagement, adding another layer of complexity.

## Overcoming the Challenges
To overcome these obstacles, I took the following steps:
- **Intensive Learning**: I dedicated time to understanding the basics of augmented reality, experimenting with **Devar (MyWebAR)**, and figuring out how to work with 3D models.
- **Troubleshooting Color Issues**: Through trial and error, I found solutions to retain color integrity in 3D models.
- **Iterative Design Process**: I made multiple adjustments to incorporate custom images that represented the spirit of IndiaNite while ensuring they fit seamlessly into the AR platform.
- **Implementing Tracking Mechanisms**: I integrated tools to track the number of QR code scans to better understand how users interacted with the AR experience.

## Outcome and Reflection
The result was the **IndiaNite AR Experience**, an immersive, interactive project consisting of four uniquely designed images with embedded QR codes leading to the same AR link. While the output was successful, this journey taught me the value of resilience and the power of merging tradition with technology.
